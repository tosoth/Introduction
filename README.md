# Introduction
Why do I start github and what am I working on.

First time when I saw github, people say that github is the "facebook for programmers".
Well, but in nowadays, in my opinion, it is more like a code pool for software and Internet company to save and copy each other's code.
And for starter, or individual, most of the programmes here are not runnable.
So here I am, for individuals, I am going to start some tiny small programme using c++ and python, or java.
First of all, they must be RUNNABLE.
