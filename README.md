# Introduction
Why do I start github and what am I working on.

First time when I saw github, people say that github is the "facebook for programmers".
Well, but in nowadays, in my opinion, it is more like a code pool for software and Internet company to save and copy each other's code.
And for starter, or individual, most of the programmes here are not runnable.
So here I am, for individuals to save, copy and use, I am going to start some tiny small programme using c++ and python, or java.
First of all, they must be RUNNABLE.
Second, they are super easy for you to migrate to your own project.
Last, you will find my target one day that I will use these toy bricks to build a bricks factory, then more people, not only coders, will join in to assemble, set, put together all these code modules like assemble toy bricks.
It is only 1-2 hours with 100-500 lines of code for each brick, but it is tens of thousands lines of code for the whole project.
And good software structure, MVC, data aggregation technique will be used.
Hope it helps everyone! :)
